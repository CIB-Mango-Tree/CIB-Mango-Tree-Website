                  This test will show when new posts (aka data entries) in your dataset were made. You can view the frequency of posts over 
                  a 24-hour period using either the output file or bar graph, making it easy to spot any unusual patterns.

              <h3>Test Process:</h3>
              <div>
                <ol>
                  <li>
                      The test will divide the timespan of your dataset (the length of time over which data was collected) into discrete 10-minute windows.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                      The test will tally how many times a pair of usernames posted within the same 10-minute window on multiple occasions throughout the duration of your dataset.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                      In order to check for larger groups that may be coordinating, the test will then count the number of times a trio of usernames posted in the same 10-minute time window in more than one instance.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                      The test will then count the number of times a quartet (4) usernames posted in the same 10-minute time window, and so on.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                      The test will cease running when the maximum group size to be posted in the same 10-minute time window in more than one instance is found.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                      The test will then rank these groups by the number of times they posted in more than one time window, from highest to lowest.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                      The test will produce a separate CSV file for each group size (pairs, trios, etc.) that was found.
                  </li>
                </ol>
              </div>
              <br><hr>

              <h3>CSV Output Format:</h3>
              <div>
                The test will produce a separate csv file for each group size that was found to have posted in more than one time window. (NOTE: The test will only produce a csv file for group sizes found. I.e. there may not necessarily be groups of size three or four which posted in the same time window over more than one occasion. Therefore, the test may not produce a csv displaying groups of size three, four etc.) 
                <br><br>Within each csv file, the test will rank each group by the number of times they posted across more than one time window, from highest to lowest. The csv will display all the instances that the usernames belonging to each group posted, including the UPNs of each post, the content of each post, and the time of each post. 
              </div>
              <br><br>

              <h5>Sample .CSV Output:</h5>

              <h5>HTML Output Format:</h5>

              <div>The test will also produce an HTML file that will show the test output in your browser in a much more human-readable form.</div>
